## ChemSINDy: Data-driven discovery of chemical reaction networks

ChemSINDy is a Python package for the automatic elucidation of chemical mechanisms from concentration time series, a central challenge in chemical reaction network theory. 
It is based on an algorithmic modification of the SINDy method that maps a sparse ODE model obtained to an admissible chemical mechanism consistent with mass-action kinetics via a convex optimisation problem.
